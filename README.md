# LegionDark Issue Tracker

Welcome to the LegionDark private server issue tracker. Here you can find and create bug reports that involve issues currently happening on the LegionDark server. This tracker is to help keep an organized collection of issues for developers to work on and fix. This tracker is not for anything except bugs/issues happening on the LegionDark server. 

**If the issue you would like to report concerns a Job Ability or Job Trait, please read [this](https://github.com/LegionDark/Issues/issues/298) first.**

### The DarkStar Project (aka "DSP") which all servers are based on has its own separate tracker here: https://github.com/DarkstarProject/darkstar/issues  
***When in doubt as to who to report your issue to, use our tracker and we will investigate/forward the issue to them if it is needed.***  
You may occasionaly be asked if you can report an issue to DSP if staff is unavailable, but we try to do that ourselves.
If you are **100% certain** the bug is **not** something you will need GM help with (example: broken mission) or specific to a customization (Example: Wonder NM) you can safely report the problem directly to them. 

## Issue Report Template. <br>DO NOT REMOVE OR CHANGE THE PRE FORMATTED TEXT.

When creating a new issue, please be sure to fill out info requested by the template, which is the **pre-filled** text in the edit box of new issues. **Failure to provide information asked for in this template or removing the formatting characters may result in your issue being closed without warning or response!**
